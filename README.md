First, it’s wise to have a prioritized shopping list. This not only helps in reducing impulse buys but ensures your gift card balance is spent on items of utmost importance and greatest value.

Pairing your gift card with sales, discounts, or promotions is an excellent method to stretch your balance further. This way, you get more for your money, essentially increasing the card's purchasing power.

By approaching your MyGift card with a strategy, you will unlock its full potential and enjoy a satisfying and rewarding shopping experience.
